    	<h2>A message of condolences</h2>
    	<p>Our former director, and long-time Arch Linux contributor, Jonathon Fernyhough, passed away on the 7<sup>th</sup> of January, 2023. The Fosshost team and community send our deepest condolences to his family and friends. You will be missed, Jonathon.</p>
        <h2>Fosshost to Sunset Tenant Services</h2>
        <p>At this time, Fosshost is deeply sorry to announce we are no longer able to continue offering our services.</p>
        <p>Because of this, we strongly recommend all Fosshost tenants to <strong>backup their data immediately, and migrate elsewhere as soon as possible.</strong>
        <h2><strong style="color: var(--accent)">Update:</strong> A Message from our Founder</h2>
        <p>Fosshost's founder and CEO has a message for our community going over the challenges the organization faced leading up to this decision and discussing the future for Fosshost.
        <p><strong><a href="founder.html">Read the letter in full here.</a></strong></p>
        <h2>Where to Go</h2>
        <p>While Fosshost is sunsetting its hosting solutions, others in the community — including some of our former volunteers — who care deeply about free software sustainability have begun building alternative homes for free and open source projects who need the support.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://radixproject.org/">The Radix Project</a></h3>
        <blockquote>The Radix Project is committed to providing free-of-charge need-based hosting on request for your FLOSS/open source endeavors.</blockquote>
        <p>The Radix Project is one such initiative, founded in part by one of the original technical architects of Fosshost.</p>
        <p><strong><a href="radix.html">Read a message from their founder here.</a></strong></p>
        <h3>Other Solutions</h3>
        <p>These organizations offer free solutions or usage for open source projects, and may be beneficial to tenants migrating off of Fosshost:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>GitLab</strong> — GitLab offers either SaaS or self-hosted access to their "Ultimate" tier commercial GitLab package, including 50,000 CI/CD minutes, for qualifying open-source projects.
