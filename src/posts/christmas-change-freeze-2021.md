Again it's that time of year when we update you on our change freeze.
We know that the services we provide to you are in peak demand over this period, and we want to give you confidence that they will operate as expected, without interruption.

Please read through the contents of this page to see when and how the change freeze 2021-22 will affect your projects, users and the wider community. The Change Freeze will be in place between the 16th December 00:00 2021 UTC to the 4th January 00:00 UTC 2022.

### Hosting Applications
Currently, remain offline until further notice pending restructuring of infrastructure.

### Support Tickets
We will continue to support projects across our services where there is a total loss of service or outage.

### Migrations
We will not honour any migrations of services during this time.

### Domains
We will not register domains during the Christmas Period.

### Infrastructure
We will not be completing any new infrastructure upgrades or deployments during the Christmas Period.

Thank you so much for being so supportive during 2021, and we wish you, your families, project and associates, a pleasant festive break.
