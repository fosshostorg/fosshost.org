Fosshost C.I.C, a UK non-profit provider of cloud computing services
for FOSS, enters into a long term partnership with Freenode Limited
(‘freenode’).

Work has begun, and the two organizations have directed staff toward
constructing long-term plans for freenode on the Fosshost network.

In the immediate, Fosshost staff will begin assisting the volunteer
team at freenode and enter long term planning and conversations
about immediate needs including with infrastructure and hosting IRC
nodes, web teams, and the IRC network's platform and operations.

In the near term, the two projects will partner to launch co/cross
branded public and tenant facing SaaS offerings, available BYOD or
levering the combined network for DNS.

As leadership teams from both organizations met to discuss approaches
to ensure the long-term sustainability and vitality of freenode,
the IRC network, Thomas Markey (Fosshost Founder, Founder and CEO)
and Andrew Lee (Freenode Limited, Owner and President) put their
conversation in light of the recent controversy surrounding freenode.

Andrew commented, saying, "Today is a momentous day in the history
of freenode, the home of FOSS.  We have identified and are working
with a proven provider of FOSS services with a compelling vision
for long term access to FOSS and for FOSS communities.  From this
day forward, we focus on the future, making sure FOSS projects and
the community have the resources they need and prefer to communicate,
to create tools that will long outlive these dramas.  For those who
choose to make freenode their home, we’re here for you."

Thomas added, "We are both committed to making freenode a great IRC
community.  But FOSS is about empowering choice.  That's our mission
and what we're focused on Today."
