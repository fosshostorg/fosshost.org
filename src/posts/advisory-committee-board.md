# Fosshost has appointed an independent Advisory Committee Board (ACB) as part of our ongoing commitment to accountability, transparency and professional standards

The ACB includes Industry Experts, FOSS Advocates and Academics at both local and international levels. Committee Members contribute a set number of hours every quarter. The advisory produces a report of recommendations and minutes to the Executive Board. This helps to provide the Fosshost Board with expert knowledge and research that allows the board to shape our strategy and vision, as well as ensure that we are accountable for our actions and decisions.  Commitee Members have a proven track record within the open source community, and often hold appointments and roles elsewhere. 

The ACB will be meeting shortly to formally meet with each other; and agree minuting, due diligence, and controls for their quarterly meets.

The following individuals from the open-source community have accepted a role on the ACB, with immediate effect:

### Dr Miquel Duran-Frigola PhD (he/him)

I am a computational biologist with a background in chemistry. My research focuses on data-driven drug discovery. I have published 22 articles in peer-reviewed journals, and I am the first or corresponding author in 12 of them. Recently, I've led the development of the Chemical Checker, a computational platform for systems pharmacology. Now, I am willing to bring the Chemical Checker closer to the clinics, especially in neglected areas. I spend most of my free time on fiction writing.

### Dr Luis Falcon M.D (he/him)

Luis Falcón, M.D., MSc, holds a degree in Computer Science and Mathematics from the California State University (USA) and in Medicine from IUCS, Buenos Aires (Argentina). He has a Master's degree in Genomics and Medical Genetics from the University of Granada (Spain). Dr Falcon is a social, animal rights and free software activist. He is the founder and president of GNU Solidario; a nonprofit humanitarian organisation focused on the advancement of Social Medicine. Dr Falcon is the author of GNU Health, the award-winning Free/Libre digital health ecosystem. He is a guest speaker at international conferences about Free Software, eHealth and Social Medicine.

### Dr Morgan Lemmer-Webber PhD (she/her)

Morgan Lemmer-Webber is an art historian, avid crafter, and FOSS user and advocate. She holds a PhD in Art History from the University of Wisconsin, Madison (USA). A lifelong exploration of various handicrafts and media inspired her dissertation research on women and textile production in the Roman empire. Morgan is interested in the intersection of FOSS and academia, particularly in digital humanities research. Morgan was also the co-organiser of the ActivityPub Conference (2019 in Prague, 2020 online), which brings together implementors and users of projects created using the ActivityPub protocol for decentralised social networking. She is the co-host of FOSS and Crafts, a podcast about free software, free culture, and making things together.

### Ariadne Conill (she/her)

I have spent the majority of my life hacking on free software, my work includes starting the IRCv3 project, writing a lot of the code commonly used in IRC servers, writing Audacious (a famous Linux music player), libucontext, pkgconf, ifupdown-ng and several other vital components of Alpine, contributing security and privacy fixes to ActivityPub (the protocol). It's implementations like Mastodon and Pleroma, packaging software for Debian, Ubuntu, and Alpine, and is one of the key people who got Alpine Linux off the ground and where it is today.
