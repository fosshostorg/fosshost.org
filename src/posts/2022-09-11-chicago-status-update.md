Unfortunately, the current situation with the node is that we are unable to reboot it as our CEO hasn't given 
anyone access to do anything with the DC.

We would urge anyone that has a VM at chihv0, to look for hosting elsewhere and contact our CEO aka Thomas Markey 
regarding it as he's the only one able to fix it.
