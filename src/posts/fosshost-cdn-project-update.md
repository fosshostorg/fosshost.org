Nearly a month ago we posted a news article launching the fosshost CDN project an AnyCast authoritative DNS, which will have a GeoIP service for load balancing between nodes in multiple regions globally.  To enhance the AnyCast service we are working hard on a fully AnyCast caching proxy in three core locations for HTTPs traffic.  

This work would not be possible without the commitment and support of our [hosting sponsors](/sponsors) and Nate Sales, our volunteer network engineer who runs [AS34553](https://natesales.net/network) who shares a passion for the movement and adoption of free software.

The CDN project will host several services exclusively for the open source community.

We have listened to your views and it will be strictly non-commercial, run by real, technical people who know what they are talking about. We will continue to provide regular updates on the CDN project progress.  

We are now accepting applications from new and existing projects who are interested in using the fosshost CDN.
